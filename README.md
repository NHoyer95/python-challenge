# python-challenge

This repo contains demonstrations of Python scripting to analyze 2 separate use cases - financial records from a bank and poll results from an election. 

Each Use Case folder (PyBank and PyPoll) contains a main.py script that can be used to analyze the corresponding .csv found in the Resources folder. Executing either script will print the results of the analysis to your preferred terminal and to the .txt file found in the Analysis folder.
